Projects I worked on in the past.

## City maps for Moscow Urban Forum

The goal was to give forum visitors a tool to compare various city parameters like population density and CO2 emission for major agglomerations (Tokyo, Seoul, New York and 5 more).

My task in this project was to develop a set of 2D city maps (3D maps were done by other developers). I used d3.js, GeoJSON, SVG and React.js.

The comparison tool was successfully deployed as a stand at the central place of the exhibition and as a website afterwards.

## Audio tagging tool

The goal was to reduce the cost of tagging audio files from call centers by developing own platform.

I was responsible for communication with the client, project specification, management and frontend development. We used Vue.js, Bootstrap and Flask.

## Candlesticks chart

My client wasn't satisfied with the [existing solutions for candlesticks charts](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/professional-candlesticks/) and wanted to develop a chart with a specific set of features.

I used React for state management and canvas for plotting.

## Online clothing store

The client wanted to move the old website to a better and faster platform with a new design.

I was responsible for the frontend. I was provided with designs and made it into working pages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (and preprocessors).
