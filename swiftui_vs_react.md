# SwiftUI vs React

diff

- CoreData vs LocalStorage
- swiftui is like react before hooks
- requests: URLSession vs fetch
- write more code with SwfitUI!
- CompletionHandler vs Callback (why do people insist on calling functions closures?)
- multiple threads (DispatchQueue) vs single thread (event loop)

similarities:

- both are component based
- declarative
